Hello ! 
1) What I found complicated in TP2 was the approach to the concepts, I really thought about doing a code that was "pretty", but going step by step helped me because it wasn't as complicated as I thought. Your Json to C# websites really helped and at the end it went quite quickly.
2) The SOLID principles are related to object-oriented programming : 
S: Single Respondibility Principle : one class --> one task
0: Open / Closed principle : Meaning the class must still be of use after new implementations 
L: Liskov's substitution principle : Each derived class must be substitutable at the level of their parent/base class
I: Interface segregation principle : Client must not depend on method they don't use neither should they be forced to install interface they don't need
D: Dependency inversion principle : Entities shouldn't depend on implementations, high level can't depend on a low level module

KISS : "Keep it simple, stupid"
Avoid all unnecessary complexity --> recommend simplicity

Boy scout rule : 
'Always leave the code better than you found it.'
Serves to avoid code degradation over time.

Clean architecture : 
Has minimum dependencies, time efficiency and helps understanding the "big picture" of the project. It helps also for doing quality code.

Clean code : 
Can be understood and modified by someone that never worked on the project. 
Uses variables names that are logical for exemple : Wordpress isn't quality code.

3) 1 - To improve my TP I could have done the graphical interface
2 - For someone to use it, it should be connected to the internet 
3 - Also, I would find it usefull to get weather information on a bigger frame, such as Estern Europe for example
4 - Also, it could calculate mean and standard deviation to use the information as statistics
5 - I would definitely would like to be bale to choose any destinations, I could by letting user choose latitude and longitude but it wouldn't point on specific cities
